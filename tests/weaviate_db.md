# 2  Formal and less formal emails

With the widespread use of instant messaging apps, written communication has become very flexible with regard to style and formality. This has also affected the way people write emails. Email writing can vary from informal chat to highly formal business correspondence.

# 5  Asking for and clarifying information

Francesco and Rebecca both work for the training department of a large company. Corporate HR has decided to implement company-wide online training programmes. Rebecca has volunteered as a test user of the trial version of the training platform. Francesco has received an email from her in which she asks various questions.

# 1

Here is Rebecca’s email. Look at the phrases in italics. How would you translate them into German?

Die Vervielfältigung dieser Seite ist für den eigenen Unterrichtsgebrauch gestattet.

Hi Francesco,

Thanks for the link to the trial version of the new training platform. The platform layout looks really good and it was easy to access.

Still, I have a question about how I can register for any particular training. When trying to register for the app writing workshop, the software kept on asking for my training code. What exactly does that mean? Could you please explain where I can find the code? If I understand you correctly, the platform is going to be open to all of our employees, or will there be any restrictions?

I also noticed that I will be able to gain credit points by taking part in certain training programmes. Could you explain that in more detail? I’m sure this will be an important point for many of our staff members.

Please get back to me when you have time.

Thank you for your help in advance.

Best wishes,

Rebecca

trial version = Testversion

access = Zugang

restrictions = Einschränkungen

# 2

This is Francesco’s email reply to Rebecca’s question. Look at the phrases in italics. How would you translate them into German?

Hello Rebecca,

Thank you very much for testing the trial version of our new platform. I’m glad you like it. Your feedback is a big help.

To answer your questions:

So, basically what you have to do is this:

–  Register by using your personnel number.

–  Then click the join button of the particular training or workshop you’re interested in.

–  Then the training code will be automatically generated by the system. To be precise, each employee will get their individual code once the platform goes live.

Let me clarify what we mean by credit points. This means that each employee will be able to gain a given number of points depending on which training they choose to take part in, meaning they might, for example, be offered a bonus once they have collected a given number of points.

I hope this answers your questions.

If any of this isn’t clear, please get back to me.

Yours,

Francesco

# Dear Ms Dubois

I’m writing to complain about the poor service we received during our conference stay at your hotel recently.

1, we had booked adequate amounts of refreshments and coffee to be served when the conference members arrived. 2, the amount of coffee and tea was insufficient, which resulted in people who arrived late not receiving any beverages at all.

3, two of the four conference rooms were not equipped with smartboards, despite the fact that I had specifically discussed your conference facilities with you over the phone. When we mentioned this to your staff on site, we were very disappointed to discover that they were knew nothing about our arrangement.

4, the air conditioning in the conference room “Nepal” stopped working on day 2 of the conference. 5 we brought this matter to the attention of the reception, the issue remained unresolved until the end of our stay. Indeed, the hotel’s front staff seemed absolutely unable to cope with the situation.

In view of this rather unsatisfactory experience we suggest you refund in full the money we paid for the use of your conference facilities.

We look forward to hearing how you are planning to deal with this matter. When writing a professional complaint, keep your letter of complaint well structured. Use linking words like those above to make your point.

# 2

Make notes about your company’s policy about complaints. If you receive a complaint, is there a timeframe by when you need to react? If you are making a complaint, do you complain in writing or over the phone? Why?

- Staff at the drop-off counter are unfriendly.

# 7 Writing an apology

Elena Dubois works as the manager of a hotel in Lyon that specializes in business conferences. She reacts to a complaint email that she has received from Lena Becker, the Travel and Event Manager of a major business client. Elena’s hotel had hosted the client’s annual international sales conference the week before.

# Most apology letters consist of the following elements:

- Acknowledgement (Eingeständnis)
- Apology (Bedauern)
- Explanation (Erklärung)
- Action (Ausblick/Entschädigung)
- Promise (Versprechen)

They don’t necessarily have to come in that order. Use different colours or codes to underline the sentences in the email that match the above elements.

Dear Ms Becker,

I would like to thank you for bringing to our attention the fact that your recent conference stay with us was not up to our usual standards. Let me assure you that providing the highest level of hospitality is our main priority.

Regarding the refreshments served on the first day of the conference, I have spoken to our catering staff and it was indeed an oversight on our part, for which I would sincerely like to apologize.

As to the technical equipment of our business facilities, I deeply regret that you were not informed in advance that two of our conference rooms needed repairs during your stay due to a technical issue, so that we were forced to change the rooms we offered you. I understand what a difficult situation this must have put you into. It seems our staff were unable to find any data projectors for you to use. The technical problem was also the reason why the air conditioning did not work in two of the rooms.

We can understand your disappointment and would like you to know that your experience does not reflect the high standards we normally offer. In compensation for the inconvenience you have experienced we would like to offer you a full refund of the business facility charges and a zero service charge on your next stay with us.

I do hope you will find this satisfactory.

We would once again like to apologize for the inconveniences caused to a valued customer. We will do our utmost to ensure that such mistakes do not occur again.

Sincerely,

Elena Dubois

# Have you ever had to apologize in writing? If so, explain why you had to apologize and how you settled the matter.

# If you work with clients and suppliers from different cultures, do they or do you write apologies that are different from those you write to clients and suppliers from your own culture?

# Vocabulary

- assure = versichern
- hospitality = Gastfreundlichkeit
- an oversight = ein Versäumnis
- inconveniences = Unannehmlichkeiten
- do our utmost = unser Bestes geben

If you work with companies from around the world, you will notice that people from different cultures apologize in different ways. However, in every culture there are three things that make for a proper apology:

- Be sincere in what you write.
- Admit your mistake.
- Offer to take corrective action.# Business correspondence

# 4

Together with a partner choose one of the three scenarios below to write an apology. Think about who you are writing to, e.g. a customer, a client, a supplier, a project team member. Use phrases from the list below.

1. Apologize for the faulty or bad quality of one of your products or services.
2. Apologize for an unforeseen change in a project schedule.
3. Apologize for the non-attendance at or the postponement of a very important meeting or event.

# 8 Expressing urgency

Hannah works as a project assistant at a large building company. It is her responsibility to ensure a smooth communication flow among the projects’ stakeholders. A lot of her correspondence has to do with setting and keeping deadlines. Today she is writing to the project manager in charge of two projects in Italy and the Netherlands.

# 1

Read the email. If the email was directed at you, how urgent do you think the three “open points” in the email would be?

Hello Marian

I hope you had a relaxing holiday. How was the weather in Zagreb?

There are a few open points I would like discuss with you regarding our construction sites in Utrecht and Carrera.

First of all, thank you for the latest update of the Utrecht project concerning milestone 2. I would like to suggest that we arrange a video conference with the Utrecht team to clarify how to deal with the delivery issues. Could you let me know when would be good for you? I will then get in touch with the Dutch team to arrange a time.

Secondly, would you be so kind as to sign the agreement with the electrical contractor for the new building site in Carrera? The company is due to start work by the end of next week, and the contract needs to be signed by then. You will find the agreement on your cloud drive. You can sign it electronically.

And finally, do you think you could you send me the overview of dates for the electrical installations regarding the construction sites in Carrera as soon as possible? Thank you.

Have a good start to the week.

Regards,

Hannah

# 2

Unfortunately, Hanna didn’t get an answer to her email. Four days later, she writes a second email. Which phrases in her email indicate that things are getting urgent now?

Hello Marian

This is a friendly reminder about the email I sent you on July 1. Unfortunately, I haven’t heard back from you yet.

Regarding the video conference with the Utrecht team, I have arranged two appointments, Aug 3 or Aug 5, each day at 10 a.m. CET. Please let me know today which date suits you best. Thank you.

Also, I urgently need you to sign the agreement with the electrical company. As I mentioned before, this is rather time-critical since they are due to start work on Friday next week. I would appreciate it if you could return a signed copy to me today, preferably before 5 p.m.

And the final point: I’m afraid I am unable to continue the planning without dates for the electrical installations. Please be so kind and upload the overview today.

If anything remains unclear, please get in touch.

Kind regards,

Hannah

# 10 Instant messaging

In order to make communication faster, a lot of companies use instant messaging systems to communicate in real time with colleagues, clients and suppliers. This form of communication tends to be less formal and more chat-like.

# 1

Read the instant messages. Which terms can you also find in the system you use? Add any others that might be useful and make a short glossary.

Hi Matt! I just sent the report to you. Please review it asap and send me your feedback.

Hey, sure! No prob. Thanks!

People use a lot of abbreviations when communicating with people they know well. This is a fun and fast way to exchange information. When using abbreviations yourself, try to use only those the recipients of your message would use themselves. Be careful when making jokes using pictures or emoticons. Remember not everybody has the same kind of humour you have.
